**Intro**
  
This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones. In this project I created an interactive page like a social media page sort of speak. It includes adding photos, removing them, edit icons, and adding required features and texts. Also for mobile sizing and make sure that it is responsive in the way as seen in figma. Used a multitude of tools and code to help me in this project like Figma, Tinypng, Images, GitHub Repo, VS Code, Media queries, BEM, Used proper links, and so forth. Talking about Figma I used Figma for a basic understanding of layout, media, fonts, placement of items as shown in the design. One important feature used was media queries for proper screen sizing on certain screens devices.

**Images**  
  Gathered images from Figma and used tinypng to help optimize pictures.

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.
